[AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs.html) has following members which provides information for `AppointmentEditorOpening` event.

[Action](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs_Action) - Gets the action (add or delete or edit) for the selected appointment.

[Appointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs_Appointment) - Gets the selected appointment details.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
this.schedule.AppointmentEditorOpening += Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening;
private void Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening(object sender, AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs e)
{
    //To handle the default appointment editior window by setting the e.Cancel value as true.
    e.Cancel = true;
    if (e.Appointment != null)
    {
        //Display the custom appointment editor window to edit the appointment
