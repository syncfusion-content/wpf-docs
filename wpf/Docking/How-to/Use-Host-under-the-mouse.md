# Use Host under the mouse

HostUnderMouse is the property, which is used to get the DockedElementTabHost that was under the dragged host. This can be used to update the relevant properties of Element Host while dragging the Float child.

{% highlight xaml %}

DockedElementTabbedHost host = DockingManager.HostUnderMouse;
