#  Accessibility Support in WPF TreeMap (SfTreeMap)

The TreeMap is designed to efficiently interact with its elements and provides voice descriptions for its items.

## Keyboard shortcuts in WPF TreeMap (SfTreeMap)

The [Syncfusion WPF TreeMap](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/treemap) supports keyboard shortcuts for user interaction. 
The following is a table outlining the various shortcuts and their associated functions:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<b> Navigation Shortcut Keys </b> <br/><br/></td><td>
<b> Descriptions </b> <br/><br/></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Tab<br/><br/></td><td> 
Moves the selection to the next item on the right in the TreeMap.
<br/><br/></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Shift + Tab<br/><br/></td><td>
 Moves the selection to the previous item on the left in the TreeMap.
<br/><br/></td></tr>
</table>

N>When [SelectionMode] (https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.TreeMap.SfTreeMap.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_TreeMap_SfTreeMap_SelectionModes) is set to Default, pressing a key clears the previous selection and selects the newly focused item. In contrast, when [SelectionMode] (https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.TreeMap.SfTreeMap.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_TreeMap_SfTreeMap_SelectionModes) is set to Multiple, the previously selected items remain selected, and additional items are selected with each key press.
