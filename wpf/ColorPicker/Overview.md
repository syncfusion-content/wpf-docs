# Overview

The ColorPicker control provides an easy and an efficient way to select colors from the color palette collection. It displays the color palette as a drop-down control. It is supplied with two varieties of visualization for viewing the colors from the palette. The selected color is highlighted with its respective name. For example, if brown color is selected, then the tool tip will display "Brown". ColorPicker comes with the support of eyedropper to fetch color in the ColorPicker.

This section also discusses the ColorEdit control, which is similar to the ColorPicker.

## Features

* The selected color is visualized in a tooltip for the benefit of the users.
* ColorPicker is used in two modes— RGB and HSV.
* Support for picking colors using eyedropper. Drag the eyedropper to anywhere in your application to pick the color of a specific location or even a point.
