# WPF Calendar (CalendarEdit) Overview

The [CalendarEdit](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Shared.CalendarEdit.html) control provides implementation of DateTime values in a calendar form. It therefore supports full range of dates allowed by that object. Effectively, any date ranging from year 0 to year 9999 A.D. can be displayed. It displays a calendar through where you can navigate to any day in a selected year. Its template can be easily modified just like any other WPF control. It is added with in-built animation to navigate between months.
