* **Summaries** – Extensive support to show concise information about the individual data columns or groups of rows.
* **Filtering** – Interactive support for filtering data as like in Excel.
* **Data validation** – Support to validate the data on errors.
* **Data virtualization** – Support for different modes of data virtualization such as paging, incremental loading.
* **Master-Detail View** – Support to display relational data using hierarchies. 
* **Printing and Exporting** – Support to print and also export the data to Excel, PDF.

## Choose between different Grid's

Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> WPF suite comes up with following different Grid’s namely,

1. [GridControl](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/excel-like-grid)
2. [GridTreeControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/classic/gridtree/overview) and [SfTreeGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/treegrid)
3. [GridDataControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/classic/griddata/overview) and [SfDataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/datagrid)

### GridControl

[GridControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/gridcontrol/overview) is designed based on the cell-oriented architecture that does not make any assumptions about the structure of the data and provides support for Excel-like features. This control can be used when the data is populated in on demand using virtualization or its internal storage. It is not possible to bind the data source directly. 

### GridTreeControl and SfTreeGrid

The [GridTreeControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/classic/gridtree/overview) and [SfTreeGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/treegrid) control is a data-oriented control that displays self-relational data in a tree structure user interface like multicolumn treeview. The data can be loaded on demand. You can move items between parent nodes by using the built-in row drag-and-drop functionality. Its rich feature set includes editing with different column types, selection, and node selection with check boxes, sorting, and filtering.

### GridDataControl and SfDataGrid

The [GridDataControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/classic/griddata/overview) and [SfDataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/datagrid) controls are used to display collection of data in rows and columns. These controls support the data binding directly. 

1. **SfDataGrid** - SfDataGrid is designed based on the WPF template-based architecture that provides support to customize the Grid easily and fully supports binding. 
2. **GridDataControl** - GridDataControl is designed based on the cell-oriented architecture of the Windows Forms Grid control that provides more control over cells and supports for Excel-like features. 

Both SfDataGrid and GridDataControl almost have the same set of features. But SfDataGrid control offers rich set of features over GridDataControl. When you want cell level customization and excel-like features you can use GridDataControl. When you want performance, customization features like styles & template features specific to WPF, you can use SfDataGrid control. Comparatively, the performance of SfDataGrid control is better than the GridDataControl.

N> `GridDataControl` is marked as classic control. In future, new features & enhancements will be added only in `SfDataGrid`. It recommended to use `SfDataGrid`.
