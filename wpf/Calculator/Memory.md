The following buttons are available in the SfCalculator control to perform memory related operations.

N> Memory property is a **Read-Only** property that is of decimal type.

### MS

MS performs memory storage. Clicking MS button will store the current value to the memory which can be retrieve and used later whenever necessary.

Clicking M+ button will increment the value already stored in the memory by the value which we want to add. The newly calculated value gets stored in the memory now.
