# WPF Tab Navigation Overview

Tab Navigation is a new control for displaying the contents of the control with transition effects. Tab navigation control facilitates the display of pages/items (with transition effects) like an Ad rotator in web applications, thereby enhancing the UI’s look and feel. It supports only .NET Framework version 4.0.
