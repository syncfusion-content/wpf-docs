# Add Reference for WPF

Syncfusion Reference Manager is the Visual Studio Add-In for WPF platform. It adds the Syncfusion assembly reference to the project, either from the GAC location or from Essential Studio installed location or from NuGet packages. It can also migrate the projects that contain the old versions of the Syncfusion assembly reference to newer or specific versions of the Syncfusion assembly reference. It supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or higher. This Visual Studio extension is included from Essential Studio 2013 Volume 3 release.

N> This Reference Manager can be applied to a project for Syncfusion assembly versions 10.4.0.71 and later.

To add the Syncfusion assembly references in Visual Studio, follow the steps below:

> Check whether the **WPF Extensions - Syncfusion** are installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by going to **Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed** for Visual Studio 2019 or later and for Visual Studio 2017 or lower by going to **Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Installed**. If this extension not installed, please install the extension by follow the steps from the [download and installation](download-and-installation) help topic.
