# Syncfusion WPF Template Studio

The WPF Template Studio is a tool Syncfusion provides specifically for building applications using their WPF components. This studio streamlines the development process by including essential Syncfusion components, managing necessary NuGet references, providing predefined namespaces, and generating component render code. It acts as a template studio wizard, making it easier for developers to create WPF applications using Syncfusion components.

I> The Syncfusion WPF Template Studio is available from v23.1.36.

N> WPF Template Studio works seamlessly with Visual Studio 2017 or later. For the Visual Studio 2015 or lower versions, it is recommended to use a [WPF project template](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/visual-studio-integration/create-project).

Create the Syncfusion WPF project using the Visual Studio Project Template by following the provided steps.

> Check whether the **WPF Extensions - Syncfusion** are installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by going to **Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed** for Visual Studio 2019 or later, and for Visual Studio 2017 by going to **Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Installed**. If this extension is not installed, please install the extension by following the steps from the [download and installation](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/visual-studio-integration/download-and-installation) help topic.

1.	Open the Visual Studio 2022.

2.	Select one of the following options to create the Syncfusion WPF application

	**Option 1:**  
	Choose **Extension -> Syncfusion -> Essential Studio for WPF -> Create New Syncfusion Project…** from the Visual Studio menu.

	N> In Visual Studio 2017, you can see the Syncfusion menu directly in the Visual Studio menu.

	**Option 2:**   
	Choose **File -> New -> Project** from the menu. This launches a new dialogue for creating a new application. Filtering the application type by Syncfusion or typing Syncfusion as a keyword in the search option can help you find the Syncfusion templates for WPF.
