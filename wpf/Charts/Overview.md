# WPF Charts (SfChart) Overview

SfChart also provides a wide variety of charting features that can be used to visualize large quantities of data, flexibility of data binding and user customization.

## Key features

* SfChart supports 38 different types of [series](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/seriestypes/series), ranging from simple [bar series](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/seriestypes/columnandbar) to complex [financial charts](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/seriestypes/financial). Each type of chart represents a unique style of representing data with more user-friendly and greater UI visualization.
* Capable of rendering large amounts of data within a few milliseconds (ms).
* Allows you to map data from the specified path by implementing [data binding](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/databinding) concepts.
* Interactive [zooming](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/interactive-features/zoompan) can be done with touch mode enabled that allows you to explore portions of large charts in more detail, with excellent performance.
* When you need more information about a particular segment in a chart, a mouse hover on the series provides much more information through [tooltip](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/interactive-features/tooltip), [crosshair](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/interactive-features/crosshair), and [track ball](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/interactive-features/trackball) behaviors.
* Supports 10 different types of [technical indicators](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/technical-indicators) that determine financial, stock, or economic trends by analyzing a set of recorded data.
* Supports multiple axes that can be stacked and spanned for multiple panes.
* SfChart provides support for rendering multiple series at the same time, with options to compare and visualize two different chart series simultaneously.
* User-friendly and provides various options for you to customize chart features like [axis](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/axis), [labels](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/adornments/label), [legends](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/legend), [series](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/seriestypes/series), etc., and visualize them accordingly.
