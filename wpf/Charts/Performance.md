# Performance in WPF Charts (SfChart)

## Performance Optimization Tips

* When your underlying data object implements INotifyPropertyChanged, you need to enable the ListenPropertyChange property of the series to make the chart listen to the property changes of your data object. However, enabling this property registers the PropertyChanged event for every object in the data source. This can affect the chart's loading time when there are a large number of data points. By default, ListenPropertyChange is set to false to avoid unnecessary event registration.

* For Line Series with a large number of data points, use fast series types like FastLineSeries and FastLineBitmapSeries for better performance.

* For Column Series with a large number of data points, use FastColumnBitmapSeries for improved rendering speed.

* For financial charts like HiLo and HiLoOpenClose with large datasets, use FastHiLoBitmapSeries and FastHiLoOpenCloseBitmapSeries respectively.

N> Support for DirectX series has been discontinued. Instead, use FastLineBitmapSeries to render a large amount of data with optimal performance.

## Deferred Real-Time Updates

You can hold and resume the series updates in dynamic update scenarios using the following methods:
