# Add Range of Points Dynamically

When you add data points to the ItemsSource dynamically, the chart series updates synchronously for each individual point added. This can impact performance when adding multiple points in succession. To optimize this process, you can use the `SuspendSeriesNotification` and `ResumeSeriesNotification` methods of the Chart control.

This approach allows you to add multiple data points at once and update the chart only after all points have been added:

{% highlight c# %}

// Suspend notifications before adding multiple points
Chart.SuspendSeriesNotification();

// Add multiple data points here
// For example:
// for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
// {
//     dataCollection.Add(new DataPoint(i, Math.Sin(i)));
// }

// Resume notifications to update the chart with all added points
Chart.ResumeSeriesNotification();

{% endhighlight %}

By using this pattern, you can significantly improve performance when adding large datasets to your chart.
