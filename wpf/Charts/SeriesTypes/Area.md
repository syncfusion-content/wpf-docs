# Area in WPF Charts (SfChart)

## Area Chart
[`AreaSeries`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.AreaSeries.html#) is rendered using a collection of line segments connected to form a closed loop area, filled with the specified color.

The following code example initializes the AreaSeries:

{% tabs %}

{% highlight xaml %}

<chart:AreaSeries XBindingPath="FruitName" Interior="#BCBCBC" 

YBindingPath="People" ItemsSource="{Binding Fruits}" >   

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# %}

AreaSeries series = new AreaSeries()
{

    ItemsSource = new ViewModel().Fruits,

    XBindingPath = "FruitName",

    YBindingPath = "People",

    Interior = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromRgb(0xBC, 0xBC, 0xBC))

};

chart.Series.Add(series);

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

You can also explore our [WPF Area Chart example](https://github.com/syncfusion/wpf-demos/tree/master/chart/Views/Basic%20Charts/Area) to know how to render and configure the area chart.

## Step Area Chart

[`StepAreaSeries`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.StepAreaSeries.html#) is similar to AreaSeries but it does not use the shortest distance to connect two data points using Bezier curves. Instead, this ChartSeries uses vertical and horizontal lines to connect the data points in a series forming a step-like progression.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight xaml %}

<chart:StepAreaSeries  Interior="#7F7F7F"  

ItemsSource="{Binding SneakersDetail}" XBindingPath="Brand" 

YBindingPath="ItemsCount"/>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# %}

StepAreaSeries series = new StepAreaSeries()
{

    ItemsSource = new ViewModel().SneakersDetail,

    XBindingPath = "Brand",

    YBindingPath = "ItemsCount",

    Interior = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromRgb(0x7F, 0x7F, 0x7F))

};

chart.Series.Add(series);

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

## Closed Area Chart

If you wish to draw the open area series (Area with stroke only at top), SfChart provides [`IsClosed`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.AreaSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_AreaSeries_IsClosed) property. By default, this property is true.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight xaml %}

<chart:AreaSeries  IsClosed="False"

XBindingPath="FruitName" Interior="#BCBCBC" 

YBindingPath="People" ItemsSource="{Binding Fruits}" /> 

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# %}

AreaSeries series = new AreaSeries()
{

    ItemsSource = new ViewModel().Fruits,

    XBindingPath = "FruitName",

    YBindingPath = "People",

    IsClosed = true,

    Interior = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromRgb(0xBC, 0xBC, 0xBC))

};

chart.Series.Add(series);

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
