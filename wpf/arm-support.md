# ARM support in WPF Controls

The Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> WPF components are compatible with ARM64 devices. You can build the application with our components. The following components/features are alone yet to be supported for ARM64 device compatibility. Based on the feasibility, we will provide the support for the below components/features soon,

* PDF library: HTML to PDF conversion
* PDF library: OCR Processing
* PDF library: PDF to image conversion

## Requirements

Install the [.NET 6.0 for ARM64 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) on an ARM64 device to compile and run the WPF applications.
