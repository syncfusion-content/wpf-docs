## Blendability


You can edit the PinnableListBox Template to give a nice look and feel by using Expression Blend.

The steps to edit the PinnableListBox Template by using Expression Blend are as follows:

1. Create a simple WPF application in Expression Blend.
2. Drag and drop the PinnableListBox into the application from the Assets tab.

This will open a dialog (below) where you can give your style a name and define exactly where you’d like to store it.

The result of these steps is an XAML, which is placed within your application. This XAML represents the default style for the PinnableListBox.


{%highlight html%}

<Grid>

<syncfusion:PinnableListBox HorizontalAlignment="Left" Height="100" Margin="145.467,108.8,0,0" 
    VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="250" Style="{DynamicResource PinnableListBoxStyle1}">
            <syncfusion:PinnableListBoxItem Content="AutoComplete"/>
            <syncfusion:PinnableListBoxItem Content="PivotGrid"/>
            <syncfusion:PinnableListBoxItem Content="IntegerTextBox"/>
</syncfusion:PinnableListBox>

</Grid>

{%endhighlight%}

All template items can now be found in the Objects and Timeline window.
