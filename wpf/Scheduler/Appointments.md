# Appointments in WPF Scheduler (SfScheduler)

The [SfScheduler](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.html) control has a built-in capability to handle the appointment arrangement internally based on the [ScheduleAppointmentCollection](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointmentCollection.html). The [WPF Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/scheduler) supports to render  normal, all-day appointments, spanned appointment, recurring appointments, and recurrence exception dates appointments.
The [ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html) is a class that includes the specific scheduled appointment. It has some basic properties such as [StartTime](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_StartTime), [EndTime](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_EndTime), [Subject](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_Subject), and some additional information about the appointment can be added with [Notes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_Notes), [Location](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_Location), and [IsAllDay](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_IsAllDay) properties.

* The Scheduler supports the functionality that arranges the appointments based on their start time and duration for the normal appointments in a day, week and workweek views.
* In an all-day panel of the day, week and workweek views, span and all day appointments are ordered and rendered based on the start date-time of an appointment that consists time duration of the appointment, followed by `IsSpanned`, `IsAllDay`, appointments respectively.
* In Timeline views, all the appointments (span, all day, and normal) are ordered and rendered based on the start date-time of an appointment that consists of the time duration of the appointment, followed by `IsSpanned`, `IsAllDay`, and normal appointments respectively.

## Scheduler item source and Mapping
The `Scheduler` supports to bind any collection that implements the IEnumerable interface to populate appointments. Map the properties in business object to [ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html) by configuring the [AppointmentMapping](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.AppointmentMapping.html) property. The following table that property shows mapping property details to `ScheduleAppointment`.

* In an all-day panel of the day, week and workweek views, span and all day appointments are ordered and rendered based on the start date-time of the appointment that consists time duration of an appointment, followed by `IsSpanned`, `IsAllDay`, appointments respectively.
[View sample in GitHub](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/spanned-appointment-scheduler-wpf)

## All day appointments
The all-Day appointment is an appointment that is scheduled for a whole day. It can be set by using the [IsAllDay](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_IsAllDay) property in the [ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html).

## Recurrence Appointment
The recurring appointment on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly interval. Recurring appointments can be created by setting the [RecurrenceRule](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceRule) property in [ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html).

### Recurrence rule
The [RecurrenceRule](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceRule) is a string value (RRULE) that contains the details of the recurrence appointments such as repeat type - daily or weekly or monthly or yearly, how many times it needs to be repeated, the interval duration, also the time period to render the appointment, and more. The `RecurrenceRule` has the following properties and based on this property value, the recurrence appointments are rendered in the SfScheduler  with its respective time period.

<table>
<tr><th>PropertyName</th>
<th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>FREQ</td>
<td>Maintains the Repeat type value of the appointment. (Example: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, Every week day) Example:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1</td></tr>
<tr><td>INTERVAL</td>
<td>Maintains the interval value of the appointments. For example, while creating the daily appointment at an interval of 2, the appointments are rendered on the days Monday, Wednesday and Friday. (creates the appointment on all days by leaving the interval of one day gap) Example:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1</td></tr>
<tr><td>COUNT</td>
<td>It holds the appointment’s count value. For example, when the recurrence appointment count value is 10, it means 10 appointments are created in the recurrence series. Example:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=10</td></tr>
<tr><td>UNTIL</td>
<td>This property is used to store the recurrence end date value. For example, when the end date of appointment is set as 6/30/2020, the UNTIL property holds the end date value when the recurrence actually ends. Example:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;UNTIL=20200725</td></tr>
<tr><td>BYDAY</td>
<td>It holds the “DAY” values of an appointment to render. For example, while creating the weekly appointment, select the day(s) from the day options (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday). When Monday is selected, the first two letters of the selected day “MO” is stored in the “BYDAY” property. While selecting the multiple days, the values are separated by commas. Example:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,WE;COUNT=10</td></tr>
<tr><td>BYMONTHDAY</td>
<td>This property is used to store the date value of the Month while creating the Month recurrence appointment. For example, while creating a Monthly recurrence appointment in the date 3, it means the BYMONTHDAY holds the value 3 and creates the appointment on 3rd day of every month. Example:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=3;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=10</td></tr>
<tr><td>BYMONTH</td>
<td>This property is used to store the index value of the selected Month while creating the yearly appointments. For example, while creating the yearly appointment in the Month June, it means the index value for June month is 6 and it is stored in the BYMONTH field. The appointment is created on every 6th month of a year. Example:FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTHDAY=16;BYMONTH=6;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=10</td></tr>
<tr><td>BYSETPOS</td>
<td>This property is used to store the index value of the week. For example, while creating the monthly appointment in second week of the month, the index value of the second week (2) is stored in BYSETPOS. Example:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO;BYSETPOS=2;UNTIL=20200725</td></tr>
</table>

### Creating the schedule recurrence appointment
The SfScheduler appointment recurrenceRule is used to populate the required recurring appointment collection in a specific pattern. The RRULE can be directly set to the [RecurrenceRule](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceRule) property of [ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html).

To get a specific appointment by using the following event and passing a parameter as `Scheduler`, Specified `Appointment` and specified `DateTime`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
Schedule.AppointmentTapped += Schedule_AppointmentTapped;

private void Schedule_AppointmentTapped(object sender, AppointmentTappedArgs e)
{
    if (e.Appointment != null)
    {
        var occurrenceAppointment = RecurrenceHelper.GetOccurrenceAppointment(this.Schedule, e.Appointment, new DateTime(2020,12,20));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> If an occurrence at the specified date is deleted or not present, then the `GetOccurrenceAppointment` method returns null.

## Recurrence pattern exceptions
Delete or change any recurrence pattern appointment by handling exception dates and exception appointments to that recurring appointment.

#### Recurrence exception dates
Delete any occurrence appointment, which is exception from the recurrence pattern appointment by adding exception dates to the recurring appointment.

#### Recurrence exception appointment
Change any occurrence appointment which is exception from recurrence pattern appointment by adding the recurrence exception appointment in the SfScheduler [ItemsSource](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.SfScheduler.html?tabs=tabid-1#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_SfScheduler_ItemsSource).

### Creating the recurrence exceptions for schedule appointment
Add the recurrence exception appointments and recurrence exception dates to `ScheduleAppointment`  or remove them from the [ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html) by using its [RecurrenceExceptionDates](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceExceptionDates) property.

#### Delete occurrence from recurrence pattern appointment or adding exception dates to recurrence pattern for schedule appointment
Delete any of occurrence which is exception from recurrence pattern appointment by using the `RecurrenceExceptionDates` property of `ScheduleAppointment`. The deleted occurrence date will be considered as recurrence exception date.

N>• The `RecurrenceId` of an exception appointment and the `Id` of its pattern appointment should have the same value. 
• The Exception recurrence appointment does not have the `RecurrenceRule`, so for an exception appointment, it will be reset to empty.
• The exception appointment should have different `Id` with original pattern appointment `Id`.
• The exception appointment should be a normal appointment and should not be created as recurring appointment, since its occurrence is from recurrence pattern.
• The recurrenceExceptionDates should be in a Universal Time Coordinates (UTC) time zone.

Add the recurrence exception appointments and recurrence exception dates to the CustomAppointment or remove them from CustomAppointment, create a custom class `Meeting` with mandatory fields [RecurrenceExceptionDates](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceExceptionDates) and [RecurrenceId](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceId).

#### Delete occurrence from the recurrence pattern appointment or adding exception dates to recurrence pattern for custom appointment
Delete any occurrence which is an exception from the recurrence pattern appointment by using the [RecurrenceExceptionDates](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceExceptionDates) property of [AppointmentMapping](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.AppointmentMapping.html) class which is used to map the exception dates to the schedule recurrence appointment. The deleted occurrence date will be considered as recurrence exception date.
To add the exception dates in the recurrence series of custom appointment, add the `RecurrenceExceptionDates`,`EventName`,`From`,`To`,`Color`,`RecurrenceRule` properties to the custom class `Meeting`.

## Appointment tooltip

An interactive tooltip provides additional details about the appointments on hovering the mouse over them.

### Enable tooltip for appointments

To enable tooltip for the scheduler appointments, use the `EnableTooltip` property of `SfScheduler.` By default, `EnableTooltip` is set to `false.` To provide users with additional information or context about appointments, simply set this property to true.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight xaml %}
 <syncfusion:SfScheduler x:Name="Schedule"
                         EnableToolTip="True">
 </syncfusion:SfScheduler>
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# %}
this.Schedule.EnableToolTip = true;
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Customize tooltip appearance

You can customize the tooltip appearance by using the `ToolTipTemplate` property in the `SfScheduler.`

The following code example shows the usage of DataTemplate.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight xaml tabtitle="MainWindow.xaml" %}
<syncfusion:SfScheduler x:Name="Schedule"
                        EnableToolTip="True">

                CornerRadius="0"
                VerticalAlignment="Stretch"
                HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"
                BorderThickness="1"
                Padding="5">
         <StackPanel>
             <TextBlock x:Name="PART_AppointmentTextBlock"
                        Text="{Binding Subject}"
                        Foreground="White"
                        FontSize="12"
