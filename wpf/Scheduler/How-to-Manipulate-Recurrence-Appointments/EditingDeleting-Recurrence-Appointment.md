# Editing/Deleting Recurrence Appointment

The same procedure followed for normal appointments while editing/deleting appointments is applicable to recurrence appointments too, but we can make a choice to either edit/delete the single occurrence of that appointment or the entire series in an intermediate confirmation pop-up that shows off and we can Edit/Delete recurrence appointment  by clicking the Edit Option in Menu.

Single clicking the recurrence appointment will open the below quick appointment window with the options, “Just this one” and “The Entire Series” enabled. It also encompasses the delete icon within it for deleting the appointments.
