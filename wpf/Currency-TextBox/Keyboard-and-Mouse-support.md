# Keyboard and Mouse Support

Up or down arrows in the CurrencyTextBox spin the values one step up or down. Mouse Scroll in the CurrencyTextBox spin values one step up or down. The spin behavior in the CurrencyTextBox can be enabled by setting the [IsScrollingOnCircle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/wpf/Syncfusion.Shared.Wpf~Syncfusion.Windows.Shared.EditorBase~IsScrollingOnCircle.html) property to true.
