# WPF Olap Client Overview

The OLAP client control for WPF supports browsing multidimensional data that is organized in the form of dimensions, measures, named sets, and KPI (key performance indicators) in a cube format. You can visualize the results in graphical and tabular formats (chart and grid). The OLAP client control is also used to create and edit a report on-the-fly that is stored for later use.

## Key features
