Syncfusion publishing all WPF NuGet packages in  [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Tags%3A%22Wpf%22+syncfusion). The Syncfusion WPF NuGet packages can be used without installing the Syncfusion Essential Studio setup. You can simply exploit the Syncfusion WPF NuGet packages in WPF application to develop with the Syncfusion WPF components.

> From v16.2.0.46 (2018 Volume 2 Service Pack 1) onwards, all the Syncfusion WPF components are available as NuGet packages at nuget.org.

[Dotnet add package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package?tabs=netcore2x) adds a package reference to the application file, then runs [dotnet restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore?tabs=netcore2x) to install the package.

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Syncfusion WPF project file is located.
2. To install a NuGet package, run the following command.

    ```dotnet add package <Package name>```

    dotnet add package Syncfusion.SfGrid.WPF

    > If you donâ€™t provide a version flag, this command will be upgrading to the latest version by default. To specify a version, add the -v parameter: dotnet add package Syncfusion.SfGrid.WPF -v 19.3.0.43.

3. Examine the Syncfusion WPF project file after the command has completed to ensure that the Syncfusion WPF package was installed. To see the added reference, open the .csproj file.

    > Restoring is done automatically with **dotnet build** and **dotnet run** in .NET Core 2.0 and later.
