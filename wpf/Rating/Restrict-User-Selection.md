# Restrict User Selection in WPF Rating (SfRating)

The SfRating control provides support to changeable or unchangeable values. This is achieved using the `IsReadOnly` property. When this property is set to true, the rating value becomes unchangeable. By default, value of this property is false.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight xaml %}

	<rating:SfRating ItemsCount="5" IsReadOnly="True"/>
	
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight C# %}

SfRating rating;
public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    rating = new SfRating();
    rating.IsReadOnly = true;
    Content = rating;
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
