# Formula Cells in WPF GridControl

Setting the CellType of a cell to a FormulaCell will allow you to enter algebraic expressions using formulas and cell references. Cell references are entries such as A11 for column A row 11 or BA3 for column BA row 3. A formula is a defined calculation from the Formula Library which, is included with Essential<sup>®</sup> Grid. This Formula Library is extensible and allows you to add additional formulas.

This section comprises the following topics:

## Defining a FormulaCell

You can use FormulaCells for every cell in a grid or for just a few cells. Even if you assign a CellType FormulaCell to every cell in a grid, the default behavior is to treat such cells as text box cells unless you start the cell entry with an equal sign. If the cell value starts with an equal sign then, the cell is considered as a formula cell and its contents are treated as such. 

To make all cells present in a grid as potential formula cells, you will have to set the CellType of the standard BaseStyle to a FormulaCell using the following code. 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
// Set up a Formula Cell.
this.gridControl1.BaseStylesMap["Standard"].StyleInfo.CellType = "FormulaCell";
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
'  Set up a Formula Cell.
Me.GridControl1.BaseStylesMap("Standard"). StyleInfo.CellType = "FormulaCell"
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Using the Formula Library

Essential<sup>®</sup> Grid's Formula Library contains the mathematical functions that are available in the .NET FrameWork's System.Math class. In addition, there are Sum and Avg members. For a complete list of these library functions, please see the Class Reference for GridFormulaEngine. You can also add additional functions to this library using your own code. 

![Sample formula library usage](Formulacells_images/formulacells.jpeg)

In the above image, cell A2 has a formula that uses four different library functions: Sqrt, Pow, Cos, and Sin.

### Supported Arithmetic Operators and Calculation Precedence

The current formula support will allow you to enter well-formed parenthetical algebraic expressions using operators and operands. The nine supported operators are shown in the precedence table given below, with operators on the same level being calculated as encountered when the expression is scanned from left to right. 

<table>
<tr>
<th>
Operations</th><th>
Symbols</th><th>
Calculation Precedence</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Multiplication, Division </td><td>
 /  *  </td><td>
1st</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Addition, Subtraction </td><td>
+  -  </td><td>
2nd</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Less Than, Greater Than, Equal, Less Than Or Equal, Greater Than Or Equal, Not Equal </td><td>
 <  > = <= >= <>  </td><td>
3rd</td></tr>
</table>


The supported operands include those listed in the table given below. An operand by itself is also a well-formed algebraic expression that can serve as an entire formula in a cell.

<table>
<tr>
<th>
Operand</th><th>
Examples</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
number</td><td>
532.1, -10.2, or 18.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
cell reference </td><td>
A12, BB1010, or Q18.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
library formula with valid arguments </td><td>
Abs(E14), Cos(-3.14), or Sum(A1:A14).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
any well formed algebraic expression </td><td>
E1+E2, Cos(2)<A4, or Abs(A1-A5).</td></tr>
</table>


Within a formula cell, a case is ignored. So, a1 is the same as A1, and Cos(3) is the same as COS(3).

## Adding Formulas to the Formula Library

Here are the steps that are required to add a function to the Function Library.

1. First, define a method that has this signature.

{% capture codesnippet1 %}
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
// Define a method whose name is the FormulaName.
public string MyLibraryFormulaName(string args)
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
'Define a method whose name is the FormulaName.
Public Function MyLibraryFormulaName(ByVal args As String) As String
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ codesnippet1 | OrderList_Indent_Level_1 }}


Here MyLibraryFormulaName must be a name that has not been already used in the Function Library and must include only letters and digits. If you want to replace an existing formula with a formula of the same name, first remove the existing formula before adding the new formula. Use the GridFormulaEngine.RemoveFunction method to remove a formula. 

Then, write an implementation for your method. Here we use code to implement a function that will sum only positive numbers that are passed in as either a range like A1:A5 and/or a list such as A1, A4, A10. The code uses the FormulaEngine helper method to extract these values from the cells. The GetCellsFromArgs method will return an array of cells from a range such as A1:A5, and GetValueFromArgs method will take cells such as A3 and return a value such as 123.3.

    GridFormulaCellModel model = this.gridControl1.CellModels["FormulaCell"] as GridFormulaCellModel;

        double sum = 0d;

        string s1;

        // Loop through any arguments and sum up the positive values.
        foreach(string r in args.Split(new char[]{','}))
        {
            // Cell range
            if(r.IndexOf(':') > -1) 
            {
                foreach(string s in engine.GetCellsFromArgs(r))
                {

The last step is to actually add your formula to the library. You should do this after the grid has been created, say in a Form.Load event handler.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
GridFormulaCellModel cellModel = this.gridControl1.CellModels["FormulaCell"] as GridFormulaCellModel;

// Add a formula named SumPosNums to the Library.
cellModel.Engine.AddFunction("SumPosNums", new GridFormulaEngine.LibraryFunction(ComputeSumPosNums));
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
Dim cellModel As GridFormulaCellModel = Me.gridControl1.CellModels("FormulaCell")

' Add a formula named SumPosNums to the Library.
cellModel.Engine.AddFunction("SumPosNums", New GridFormulaEngine.LibraryFunction(AddressOf ComputeSumPosNums))
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
