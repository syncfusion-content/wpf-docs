#  Determining the Clicked Position in the WPF PDF Viewer

Use the [PageClicked](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_PdfViewerControl_PageClicked) event of the Syncfusion WPF PDF Viewer control to capture the exact location where the user clicks on a PDF page. The event provides pixel coordinates, which can be converted to PDF points and adjusted for the viewer’s zoom level to yield accurate positions on the document.

Refer to the code snippet below for implementation details

{% highlight c# %}

 private void PdfViewer_PageClicked(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PageClickedEventArgs args)
 {
     //Get the current point where the mouse is clicked. The value is in pixels.
     Point currentPointInPixels = args.Position;

     //Convert the point from pixels to points.
     PdfUnitConvertor convertor = new PdfUnitConvertor();
     System.Drawing.PointF currentPoint = convertor.ConvertFromPixels( new System.Drawing.PointF((float)currentPointInPixels.X, (float)currentPointInPixels.Y), PdfGraphicsUnit.Point);

     //Convert the point based on the zoom factor.
     float zoomFactor = (float)pdfViewer.ZoomPercentage / 100;
     System.Drawing.PointF finalPoint = new System.Drawing.PointF(currentPoint.X / zoomFactor, currentPoint.Y / zoomFactor);

     //Display the point through message box.
     MessageBox.Show("The point clicked is: " + finalPoint.ToString());
 }
