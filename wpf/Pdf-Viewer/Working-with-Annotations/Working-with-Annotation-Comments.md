## Expand/Collapse the comments pane

The user can expand or collapse the comments pane of the ‘PdfViewerControl’ by setting the 'CommentSettings.IsExpanded' property to true or false. By default, the value of 'IsExpanded' is false.
Refer to the following code example to expand the comments pane.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

Private void button_Click(object sender,RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    //expand the comments pane
    pdfViewer.CommentSettings.IsExpanded = true;
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight VB %}

Private Sub button_Click(sender As Object, e As RoutedEventArgs) 
    'expand the comments pane.
    pdfViewer.CommentSettings.IsExpanded = true
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The sample project to expand the comments pane in the PDF Viewer is available in the [GitHub](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/WPF-PDFViewer-Examples/tree/master/Annotations/Comments).

## Show/Hide the comments button in the annotation toolbar

The user can show or hide the comments button in the annotation toolbar of the ‘PdfViewerControl’ by setting the 'CommentSettings.IsVisible' property to true or false. By default, the value of 'IsVisible' is true.
Refer to the following code example to hide the comments button in the annotation toolbar.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

Private void button_Click(object sender,RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    //hide the comments button in the annotation toolbar
    pdfViewer.CommentSettings.IsVisible = false;
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight VB %}

Private Sub button_Click(sender As Object, e As RoutedEventArgs) 
    'hide the comments button in the annotation toolbar.
    pdfViewer.CommentSettings.IsVisible = false
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
