After the tool is enabled, you can erase the unwanted parts by holding the mouse button down and drag over the parts of an ink annotation.

The Eraser tool can also be enabled programmatically using the [AnnotationMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_PdfViewerControl_AnnotationMode) property of the [PdfDocumentView](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfDocumentView.html) and [PdfViewerControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html). Please refer to the following code.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

pdfViewer.AnnotationMode = PdfViewerAnnotationMode.InkEraser;

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> This tool can be used to erase the ink annotation only and not applicable for other annotations.

## Events

The [PdfViewerControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html) notifies through events, when [AnnotationChangedAction](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.AnnotationChangedAction.html) such us adding, deleting, select, deselect, moving and resizing made in annotations. It also provides the annotations common information such as annotation name, page index, bounds and action type performed in respective annotation. 

### InkAnnotationChanged Event

The [InkAnnotationChanged](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_PdfViewerControl_InkAnnotationChanged) event occurs when the [Action](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.AnnotationChangedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_AnnotationChangedEventArgs_Action) performed in ink annotation. It provides the common information and annotation properties which are available in `Settings` through the [InkAnnotationChangedEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.InkAnnotationChangedEventArgs.html). The user can modify the annotation properties through [Settings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.InkAnnotationChangedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_InkAnnotationChangedEventArgs_Settings).

The following code shows how to write the `InkAnnotationChanged` event in `PdfViewerControl`

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

private void PdfViewer_InkAnnotationChanged(object sender, InkAnnotationChangedEventArgs e)
{
    //COMMON PROPERTIES
    //AnnotationChangedAction to identify action performed for annotation 
    AnnotationChangedAction action = e.Action;
    //Page index in which this shape annotation was modified 
    int pageNumber = e.PageNumber;
    //Annotation's previous position and current position 
    RectangleF currentBound = e.NewBounds;
    RectangleF previousBound = e.NewBounds;
    PdfViewerInkSettings settings = e.Settings;
    //Annotation's properties which can be modify 
    string author = settings.Author;
    string subject = settings.Subject;
    string Text = settings.Text;
    float opacity = settings.Opacity;
    System.Windows.Media.Color color = settings.InkColor;
    double thickness = settings.Thickness;
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
