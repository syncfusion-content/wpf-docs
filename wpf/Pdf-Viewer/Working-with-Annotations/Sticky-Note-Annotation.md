### StickyNoteAnnotationChanged Event

The [StickyNoteAnnotationChanged](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_PdfViewerControl_StickyNoteAnnotationChanged) event occurs when the [Action](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.AnnotationChangedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_AnnotationChangedEventArgs_Action) performed in sticky note annotation. It provides the common information and annotation properties which are available in `Settings` through the [StickyNoteAnnotationChangedEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.StickyNoteAnnotationChangedEventArgs.html). The user can modify the annotation properties through [Settings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.StickyNoteAnnotationChangedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_StickyNoteAnnotationChangedEventArgs_Settings).

private void PdfViewer_StickyNoteAnnotationChanged(object sender, StickyNoteAnnotationChangedEventArgs e)
{
    //COMMON PROPERTIES
