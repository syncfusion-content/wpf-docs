The PdfViewerControl notifies through events, when [AnnotationChangedAction](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.AnnotationChangedAction.html) such us adding, deleting, select, deselect, moving and resizing made in annotations. It also provides the annotations common information such as annotation name, page index, bounds and action type performed in respective annotation. 

### ShapeAnnotationChanged Event

The [ShapeAnnotationChanged](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_PdfViewerControl_ShapeAnnotationChanged) event occurs when the [Action](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.AnnotationChangedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_AnnotationChangedEventArgs_Action) performed in shape annotation. It provides the common information, [Type](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.ShapeAnnotationChangedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_ShapeAnnotationChangedEventArgs_Type) and its annotation properties which are available in [Settings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.ShapeAnnotationChangedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_ShapeAnnotationChangedEventArgs_Settings) through the [ShapeAnnotationChangedEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.ShapeAnnotationChangedEventArgs.html). The user can modify the annotation properties through [Settings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.ShapeAnnotationChangedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_ShapeAnnotationChangedEventArgs_Settings).
