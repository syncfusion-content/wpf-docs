# Localization in WPF Pdf Viewer

Localization is the process of configuring the application to a specific language. [PdfViewerControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html) provides support to localize all the static text used for tooltip and context menu contents. Localization can be done by adding resource file (.resx) in the application.
We are using `en-US` culture-based resource file as default in PDF Viewer. This can be downloaded from this [GitHub](https://github.com/syncfusion/wpf-controls-localization-resx-files/tree/master/Syncfusion.PdfViewer.WPF) location.


## Adding Resource file

* Create a folder name as `Resources` in your application.
* Add default English (“en-US”) [Resx](https://github.com/syncfusion/wpf-controls-localization-resx-files/blob/master/Syncfusion.PdfViewer.WPF/Syncfusion.PdfViewer.WPF.resx) (resource) file of `PdfViewerControl` in `Resources` folder named as Syncfusion.PdfViewer.WPF.resx.
* Create a Resx (resource) files and name it as Syncfusion.PdfViewer.WPF.[Culture name].resx. For example, Syncfusion.PdfViewer.WPF.fr.resx for French culture. 
* Add the resource key such as `OpenDocument` and its corresponding localized value in Syncfusion.PdfViewer.WPF.fr.resx file. Refer the below screenshot for the same.
* Execute the application in French culture to see the changes.

## Localize Resource File with Different Assembly or Namespace

In general, [PdfViewerControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html) try to read the resource file from executing assembly and its default namespace can be done using [Assembly.GetExecuteAssembly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.getexecutingassembly?view=net-7.0) method. When the resource file is located at different assembly or namespace, it can set to the [PdfViewerControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html) by using [LocalizationManager.SetResources](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.TreeView.LocalizationManager.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_TreeView_LocalizationManager_SetResources_System_Reflection_Assembly_System_String_) method.

public MainWindow()

    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("fr-FR");
	
    // Set the Custom assembly and namespace for the localization.
    LocalizationManager.SetResources(typeof(Custom_Class).Assembly, "ClassLibrary");
    InitializeComponent();
}
