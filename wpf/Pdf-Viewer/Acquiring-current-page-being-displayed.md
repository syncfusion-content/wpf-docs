# Acquire current page being displayed in WPF Pdf Viewer

PDF Viewer supports acquiring the index of the page being displayed in the PDF Viewer at any moment using the [CurrentPageIndex](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.PdfViewer.PdfViewerControl.html#Syncfusion_Windows_PdfViewer_PdfViewerControl_CurrentPageIndex) property. The following code example illustrates the same.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

//Initialize PDF Viewer.
PdfViewerControl pdfViewer1 = new PdfViewerControl();
//Load the PDF.
pdfViewer1.Load("Sample.pdf");

// Acquiring the number of page being displayed in the Viewer  
int pageCount = pdfviewer1.CurrentPageIndex;


{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight vbnet %}

'Initialize PDF Viewer.
Private pdfViewer1 As New PdfViewerControl()
'Load the PDF.
pdfViewer1.Load("Sample.pdf")

' Acquiring the number of page being displayed in the Viewer
Dim pageCount As Integer = pdfviewer1. CurrentPageIndex

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
