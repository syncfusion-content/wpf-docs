# Calculated Field in WPF Pivot Grid

The pivot grid inserts a new calculated field based on the existing calculated items using the calculated field window. This option is available as a menu item in the grouping bar context menu.

**Inserting a new calculated field in pivot grid**

To insert a new calculated field, open the calculated field window using the grouping bar context menu. Then, define a **Name** for the new calculated field.
