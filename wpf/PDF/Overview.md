# Overview

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format used to present documents in a manner independent 
of application software, hardware, and operating systems. Each PDF file encapsulates a complete 
description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other 
information required to display it. Essential PDF with its robust and simple APIs allows you to 
create PDF documents.
