# Upgrade from one version to another version.

You can upgrade to the latest version by downloading and installing the platforms you require from [this](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/latest-version) link. After upgrading to the latest version, instead of upgrading your projects manually, you can use the Syncfusion Project Migration for migrating your projects.
