## Is it possible to view the Generated Report [DOC] by using Essential DocIO?

No. Essential DocIO does not have a Graphical User Interface(GUI) to view the generated DOC files. Microsoft Word is required to view the DOC files generated by using DocIO. However, there is a free Word Viewer from Microsoft that can also be used to view DOC files, and hence does not require the end-users to purchase Microsoft Word.
