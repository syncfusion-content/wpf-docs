* Once you can resize the lane, the swimlane will be resized automatically.
* The lane can be resized either resizing the selector or the tight bounds of the child object. If the child node move to edge of the lane it can be automatically resized.
* The `SwimlaneChildChangedEvent` will notify the [`UnitHeight`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.SwimlaneChildViewModel.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Diagram_SwimlaneChildViewModel_UnitHeight) and [`UnitWidth`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.SwimlaneChildViewModel.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Diagram_SwimlaneChildViewModel_UnitWidth) changes with their old and new values.
