# UML Diagrams

UML (Unified Modeling Language) Diagrams serve as a standardized means to represent diverse facets of a system, facilitating communication and comprehension for software developers, analysts, and stakeholders. UML Behavioral Diagrams, specifically, play a crucial role in visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the dynamic aspects of a system. They aid in visualizing and determining the model, execution flow, state, or behavior of the system at a specific time.

## UML Diagram Shapes

Creating UML Diagrams involves the selection and combination of various UML shapes to provide a visual representation of a system's architecture. Each shape carries a distinct meaning and usage, collectively contributing to the overall clarity and comprehensibility of the diagram.

The list of UML Diagram Shapes are available in the diagram resource dictionary, as follows:
